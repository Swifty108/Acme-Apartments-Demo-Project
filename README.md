# Acme Apartments Demo Web App

This is an ASP.NET Core MVC demo Web App used to manage a fictional apartment complex.

## Features:

There are three primary roles in the application: `Applicant`, `Resident`, and `Manager`.

The following is the flow of user interactions in the application: 

1. A visitor to the website applies for an apartment through the floorplans page and acquires the status of an `Applicant`. The applicant account dashboard features the ability to view the application status and contact the apartment staff.
2. Once the manager approves the application, the `Applicant` is promoted to `Resident` status. Residents can submit maintenance requests and view their application status if they applied. 
3. A `Manager` can approve or disapprove an application along with the authority to approve or deny maintenance requests
